# Morph

The alpha version of the app is live [here](https://morph-340013.firebaseapp.com/)!

Morph is an app designed to help you learn Chinese by allowing you to translate a word from your native language into Chinese, then decomposing the Chinese word into characters. I find that this is especially useful in learning and remembering semantically "transparent" words like "volcano", which is "火山" in Chinese. The character 火 can be translated as "fire", and 山 as "mountain". 

My currently-underdeveloped hypothesis is that words like this are easier to learn and recall when you're taught what their constituent characters mean. Myself and my collaborators are currently developing a study that will assess a related research in question situated in the greater context of Chinese second-language acquisition.

## Disclaimer

This technique works well with transparent words, but less well with words that are partially opaque (like "grasshopper", which in Chinese is "蚱蜢" - both morphemes can be translated individually as "grasshopper", but never appear by themselves) or entirely opaque (like "radar", which is "雷达", lit. "thunder (reach) up to"). I have some ideas about features that could support the learning of more opaque words, but nothing firm yet. Have an idea? Open an [issue](https://github.com/jammerware/morph/issues/new)! Your feedback is valuable, because I'm a Chinese neophyte.
